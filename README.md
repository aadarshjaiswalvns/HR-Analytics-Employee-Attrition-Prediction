# üßë‚Äçüíº HR Analytics ‚Äì Employee Attrition Prediction

Built and trained a machine learning model to predict employee attrition using real-world HR data.  
Visualized key attrition drivers such as salary, job satisfaction, and overtime using charts.  
This showcase-ready project delivers actionable insights for HR stakeholders.

## üìå Project Objective

To analyze employee data and predict attrition using machine learning.  
The objective is to help HR teams identify at-risk employees and improve retention strategies.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

---

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- Features include: Age, MonthlyIncome, OverTime, JobSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance, and Attrition flag

---

## üîç Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Encoding**
   - Converted `Attrition` to binary
   - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized attrition by income, age, job satisfaction, overtime, and job role

3. **Model Training**
   - Used **Random Forest Classifier** to build a predictive model

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

5. **Feature Importance**
   - Extracted top features contributing to employee attrition

---

## üìä Sample Insights

- Employees working **OverTime** are significantly more likely to leave.
- Low **Job Satisfaction** and **Monthly Income** strongly correlate with higher attrition.
- Top contributing features include:
  - `OverTime`
  - `JobLevel`
  - `MonthlyIncome`
  - `Age`

---

## ‚úÖ Results

- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Performance:** High precision and recall on attrition cases
- **Output:** Classification report + Bar chart of top features

---

## üìÅ Files Included

- `hr_attrition_project.py` ‚Äì Full Python script (data processing, model training, evaluation)
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project documentation
