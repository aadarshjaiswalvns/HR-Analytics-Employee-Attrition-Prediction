# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Built and trained a machine learning model to predict employee attrition based on HR datasets. Visualized key attrition drivers such as salary, satisfaction, and workload using charts. Delivered clear insights for HR stakeholders, making it a showcase-ready project for analytics or data science roles.

📌 Project Objective

To analyze employee data and predict attrition using machine learning. The goal is to help HR teams identify at-risk employees and improve retention strategies.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset

IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Available on Kaggle

🔍 Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Encoding: Converted 'Attrition' to binary and applied one-hot encoding to categorical columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Identified patterns in attrition by monthly income, age, job satisfaction, etc.

Model Training: Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict attrition.

Evaluation: Used precision, recall, F1-score for performance evaluation.

Feature Importance: Identified top 10 factors contributing to employee attrition.

📊 Sample Insights

Employees with overtime are more likely to leave.

Lower monthly income and job satisfaction also show higher attrition.

Top factors influencing attrition include: OverTime, JobLevel, MonthlyIncome, Age.

✅ Results

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation: High precision in detecting attrition cases

Output: Classification report and bar chart of top features
